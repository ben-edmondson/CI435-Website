			  <h3>Working remotely</h3>
			  </header>
			  <p>Working remotely has been very difficult for many students due to the lowered natural interaction between students and lecturers. This requires students to be more involved with the process rather than relying on lecturers/teachers to interact with them. Learning how to communicate effectively is a key area in finding success when learning remotely. Hopefully some of the resources provided on this page will allow you to better learn during these tough times where remote learning is a necessity.</p>

			  <h3>Making revision notes</h3>
			  </header>
			  <p>Making Revision notes while remote is effectively the same as it would be in person. The only difference is perhaps the form in which you take your notes. In most instances it would be best to use a note taking app on a computer so that you can keep up with your lecture and take effective notes. In this regard, it may be useful considering having the lecture open on a different computer so that you can both see the lecturer and take notes at the same time. This would improve the speed at which you could take notes. It is much faster than writing on paper, as well as this it also means that you will have an easy time later accessing your notes, and editing them if you so need. </p>

			  <h3>Research skills</h3>
			  </header>
			  <p>Researching remotely does have a significant disadvantage in one way to being able to directly access university resources in person. You will have to spend more time looking for resources as they are not as easy to find. However there are many ways in which this disadvantage can be using sourcing sites such as Google Scholar. Websites such as these will help you find articles and papers that will be relevant to your search. As well as this they usually have some form of referencing tool built in.</p>
